<p>Do you love board games? Do you love organizing them for
 quick setup, quick clean-up, and to avoid losing pieces? Do you love using zip-lock baggies? Do you ever wonder which pieces go into which baggie at the end of the game? Do you like having each players' pieces in their own bag so you can leave the player pieces you don't need in the box?</p>
<p> We provide coloried baggies for board games... by gamers, for gamers.
