<p><strong>Shipping & Returns</strong></p>
<p>Due to the weight of most of our products, and to simplify the shipping process, I use flat-rate shipping options whenever possible. Each shipping option holds a certain number of units of product, and each product uses a certain number of units. This allows me to give you the least expensive shipping option that can fit your order. Note that this means that sometimes you can add more to your order without increasing the shipping cost, but other times it will increase your shipping to the next more expensive flat-rate option.</p>
<p>If your order is missing items or is defective in some fashion, please contact us ASAP so we can send you the proper replacement items (please note that these baggies are manufactured with a tolerance of +/- 1/4" which means your baggies might be as much as 1/4" larger or smaller in either direction: baggies within this range are not considered defective and will not be replaced).</p>
<p>If you are unhappy with your purchase you may contact us and return your items in unused condition for a full refund, minus our shipping costs.  You are responsible for the return shipping costs.</p>
