               Dragon Template v1.0 - tested with Zen-Cart 1.3.9, 1.5.0, 1.5.1
	       (and probably compatable with other 1.3x and 1.5x versions too)
                               =============================

                               =============================
Upload the "includes" folder(and all subdirectories) to your zen cart root directory(top level of Zen Cart installation)

Enable the template
Immediately go to ( Tools > Layout Boxes Controller ) and reset your boxes.
Enable CSS Buttons at ( Configuration > Layout Settings > CSS Buttons )


Optionally:
Set your sidebar width on same layout settings page. 
Disable a sidebar if you like and change other settings to taste
Create EZ-Pages and link them in the header (as this creates the signature red bar at top)
